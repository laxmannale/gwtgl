#summary An overview of the GwtGL wrapper.

= Introduction =

The GwtGL wrapper is a thin API around WebGL and the GwtGL binding.
The aim is not to construct a new and contrary API for WebGL, but to improve and ease the usage of the existing API in an object oriented manner and adds support for standard Java/GWT features where reasonable.
So some parts are mapped 1:1 in the wrapper but others are constructed in an slightly different way to get simpler access to the features.
In summary, the original WebGL/OpenGL ES mode of operation is kept.

The aim for the GwtGL developers is to create a basic wrapper object for every WebGL object, to enrich its API bit by bit and add support for standard Java/GWT features.

= Features =

Some of the current features of the GwtGL wrapper are:
 * The wrapper uses enums instead of numeric constants for improved type safety
 * All methods that operate on one object are wrapped together in that object
 * Transparent resource handling
   * Support of GWT ClientBundle/ImageResource for textures
 * Automatic index calculations for multiple arrays contained in one buffer
 * Java Iterable/Iterator support for Array types
