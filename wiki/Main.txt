= What is GwtGL? =

GwtGL provides a basic GWT widget and [BindingOverview binding] for the upcoming WebGL standard (maintained by the WebGL working group at Khronos Group).

GwtGL enables you to develop 3D websites and web applications using the Java programming language instead of !JavaScript.
Type safety and the Java Toolset help you to write your apps in less time compared to plain !JavaScript development.
The GWT compiler generates optimized !JavaScript code, so you will achieve higher frame rates.

A second part of GwtGL is an object oriented [WrapperOverview wrapper] API.
This API tries to help you writing WebGL applications using GWT and object oriented programming best practices.

= What is WebGL? =

WebGL is a graphics API based on OpenGL ES 2.0. 
It enables developers to create hardware accelerated 3D graphics which can be embedded into HTML websites.
All mayor browsers will support WebGL in the near future, 
so there is no need for a plugin to be able to view WebGL enriched sites.

= Using GwtGL in your GWT project =

Include GwtGL into your classpath.
Add the following line to your *.gwt.xml to have access to the WebGL [BindingOverview binding]:
{{{
<inherits name='com.googlecode.gwtgl.binding'/>
}}}
Add the following line to your *.gwt.xml to have access to the WebGL wrapper:
{{{
<inherits name='com.googlecode.gwtgl.wrapper'/>
}}}

= Getting started =

The easiest way to start learning GwtGL is to read the [Documentation] in our wiki.
Don't forget to install a [BrowserSupport WebGL compatible browser].
