#summary Tutorial: Description how to get a WebGL compatible browser.
#sidebar TableOfContents

As the work on WebGL is still in progress, only few browsers provide support
for it in their *head builds*. You need to use unstable versions, so be sure what you do!
Browsers with WebGL Support are:
  * !WebKit Nightly Builds (http://nightly.webkit.org/)
  * Google Chrome (use the dev channel: http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel)
    * Start browser with _chrome.exe --enable-webgl --no-sandbox_
  * Firefox 3.7 pre Alpha aka Minefield(http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/)
    * Firefox 3.7 pre Alpha portable (http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable/test#minefield)
    * Open _about:config_ and set value _webgl.enabled_for_all_sites_ to _true_

Other browsers do *NOT* support WebGL.

Use current builds of the mentioned browsers. As WebGL itself is not stable,
APIs and their implementation change. We try to keep compatibility to current builds of the browsers.

Firefox 3.7 is not compatible with the dev mode extension. The dev mode is thus not usable with Firefox 3.7.
The dev mode extension for Chrome works with the dev channel but WebGL doesn't work in dev mode and throws weired errors.
Therefore it is necessary to deploy your GwtGL app and test it in web mode.
